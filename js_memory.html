    // The value gets stored in the new variable - not a pointer to the first variable, so updating the first one won't change the second.
      
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
 /*   const team = players; 
    console.log(players, team); // they're the same 
      
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players); */
    // We updated team -> team is just a reference to the original players array 
    // When you use '=' syntax it creates a REFERENCE rather than a copy

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // Use slice()
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'lux';
    console.log(team2. players);
    

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); 
      
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
      
    // or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person.age);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99})
    // take a blank object, second arg is the object we want a copy of, then we can optionally overwrite or add properties with the third argument.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
 /*   const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);*/

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
